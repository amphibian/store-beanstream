This extension adds [Beanstream](http://www.beanstream.com) as an available payment gateway in [Expresso Store](https://exp-resso.com) 2.1+ for [ExpressionEngine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine).

The gateway allows setting a unique merchant ID for Canadian, US, and international orders, as well as a test mode (provided a sandbox merchant ID) and a debug mode from troubleshooting server requests. It lo supports SHA-1 hash authentication (though in testing I found this Beanstream setting very finicky - your mileage may vary).
